This repo contains a number of exercises related to various shell topics.
Within the exercises directory, there are subdirectories containing a topic.
Each topic contains a number of shell scripts to implement. The purpose of each
shell script is described in the comment at the top of each file.

Each sub-directory also contains a test suite. This can be run by executing the
