# Description

You've got a copy of the yellow-pages (it's like google for old people).
You need to write a couple of scripts that extract some data from the yellow
pages.

Your task is to create 4 scripts:

```
num-doctors.sh
#
# this script should find the number of doctors in the yellow pages and print
# the answer to stdout

num-dr-smith.sh
#
# this script should find the number of dr smiths in the yellow pages and print
# the answer to stdout


first-engineer.sh
#
# this script should find the record for the first engineer and print it to
# stdout

last-5-records.sh
#
# this script should find the last five records in yellow pages and print to
# stdout
```

## Test runner

It's a good idea to use the test runner for testing your scripts.
To see if your scripts pass the tests, run the `./test-redirection.sh" script.

Each test contains a description that will let you know on which script the test
is based:

```bash
cat tests/1.desc
this should test if the script num-doctors.sh outputs correct number

cat tests/2.desc
this should check the output of num-dr-smith.sh

cat tests/3.desc
this should check the output of first-engineer.sh

cat tests/4.desc
this should check the output of last-5-records.sh
```


As you complete the tests, the test runner should show which ones are passing
and which ones are failing:

```
redirection % ./test-redirection.sh                                                                    (mainâ—†) ~/Code/tuw/datalab/dev-onboarding/shell/exercises/redirection
test 1: passed
test 2: out incorrect
  what results should be found in file: tests/2.out
  what results produced by your program: tests-out/2.out
  compare the two using diff, cmp, or related tools to debug, e.g.:
  prompt> diff tests/2.out tests-out/2.out
zsh: exit 1     ./test-redirection.sh
```
